        <h1>Data Science</h1>
        <p>A brief introduction to data science: start here if you are lost.</p>
        <h2><strong>What is data science?</strong></h2>
        <p>Well, if you have just woken up from a 10-year coma and have no idea what is data science, don’t worry, there’s still time. Many years ago, statisticians had some pretty good ideas for analysing data and getting insights from it, but they lacked the computational power to do it, so their hands were tied. Until one day, when computers managed to catch up with those guys, and made all their dreams come true. All of a sudden, we not only had more data available than ever in history, but we also had powerful machines to perform heavy calculations on this data, allowing statisticians to try out all these new algorithms. Data science is the hip daughter born from this marriage between statistics and computer science. In other words, it is the science of extracting useful patterns from data sets by use of computer power.</p>
        <h2><strong>What is it used for?</strong></h2>
        <h2><strong>Marketing and sales</strong></h2>
        <p>A typical use case for data science in marketing is product recommendation. When you check out a product on Amazon and they tell you there’s another product you might like, there is an algorithm behind that recommendation that thinks you will like those products based on what other customers who also saw that product actually bought.</p>
        <h2><strong>Finance</strong></h2>
